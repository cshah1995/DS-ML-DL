# IPL-Score-Predictor-Model
I have used the IPL deliveries dataset which contains all the ball by ball data from 2008-2017 IPL seasons.
This model helps predict the score at the end of an innings for a team against any opposition on any given stadiums in India, based on a minimum requirement of 5 overs to be completed.
I have used certain algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forests, etc.
The algorithm predicts scores with an error of 15 runs.
